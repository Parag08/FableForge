# Frontend of Go React Project

This is the frontend part of the Go React Project. It is built using React and serves as the user interface for the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd go-react-project/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` directory with the optimized production files.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
- `public/`: Contains the static files, including `index.html`.
- `package.json`: Contains the project metadata and dependencies.
